You can check online weather websites such as AccuWeather, Weather.com, or the National Weather Service (NWS) for the current weather conditions. You can enter \"Boston, MA\" or \"Boston, MA\" and \"San Francisco\" in the corresponding search boxes to get the current weather conditions.\n2. You can also download a weather app from your phone or tablet, such as AccuWeather, Weather Underground, or Dark Sky, which can provide you with current weather conditions for any location.\n3. If you want to check the current weather conditions for specific cities, you can use a mapping service like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, and enter the coordinates of the city in the format \"latitude, longitude\".\n\nIf you want, I can provide you with a function to demonstrate how to retrieve the current weather conditions for a specified location. However, please note that this function would require you to supply the location's name and a unit of temperature (either Celsius or Fahrenheit).\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to provide a function to accomplish this, and I'll be happy to help![engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"
