        "output": "Cooking steak Indian style sounds like a great idea! Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Indian-Style Steak Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1-2 steaks ( Ribeye, Sirloin, or Fillet), approximately 1 inch thick\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon garam masala powder\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt and black pepper, to taste\n* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger\n* 1/4 cup plain yogurt\n* Chopped cilantro, for garnish\n* Spice powder ( Lal Maas), for serving (available at Indian grocery stores or online)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Marinate the steak**: In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, garam masala, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper. Add the garlic and ginger; mix well. Add the steak and marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n2. **Grill or pan-fry the steak**: Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill for 4-5 minutes per side, or until the steak reaches your desired level of doneness. Alternatively, pan-fry in a hot skillet with a small amount of oil until cooked to your liking.\n3. **Finish with spice**: In a small bowl, mix together the spice powder ( Lal Maas). Sprinkle this spice powder over the steak during the last minute of cooking.\n4. **Rest and serve**: Let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or roti.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use a flavorful oil**: Choose an oil with a rich, nutty flavor, such as avocado or grapeseed oil, to add depth to the dish.\n* **Don't overcook**: Steak should be cooked to its desired level of doneness. Use a thermometer to check for internal temperatures: 130\u00b0F - 135\u00b0F for medium-rare, 140\u00b0F - 145\u00b0F for medium, and 150\u00b0F - 155\u00b0F for medium-well.\n* **Add aromatics**: Before marinating and cooking the steak, saut\u00e9 some onions, ginger, and garlic to create a flavorful base.\n* **Experiment with spices**: Feel free to adjust the spice powder to your taste. You can also add other spices like cumin powder, coriander powder, or turmeric for added depth.\n\nI hope you enjoy this Indian-style steak recipe![engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

        "output": "The Imjin War, also known as the Imjin-Yi War, was a brutal and devastating conflict fought between South Korea and Japan from 1592 to 1598. It was a war of expansion and conquest, and its name is often translated to \"The War of the Black Flag\".\n\nThe conflict started when Japanese pirates and samurai, led by Miyamoto Musashi, traveled to Korea to plunder its riches and establish a base of operations. The Korean government, weakened by internal conflicts and external threats, hesitated to resist the invaders. However, the samurai, who were known for their martial skills and bravery, saw an opportunity to exploit the situation and launched a surprise attack on the Korean army.\n\nThe war was marked by brutal combat, exploitation of Korean resources, and massacres of Korean civilians. The Japanese army, with their superior firepower and tactics, were able to launch a quick and decisive victory over the Korean army. Many Korean soldiers were also forced to flee or surrender, and the war came to be remembered as a dark chapter in Korea's history.\n\nThe war also had significant economic and cultural impacts on Korea, with many of its resources, including its trade schedule and export of salt, being disrupted by the war. The war also led to a period of increased isolationism in Korea, with the Korean government seeking to reassert its sovereignty and independence.\n\nThe Imjin War is still remembered today as a traumatic event in Korean history, and its legacy continues to have an impact on the country's politics, economy, and cultural identity.\n\nHere are some key points about the Imjin War:\n\n* Cause: The war was sparked by the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592.\n* Duration: The war lasted from 1592 to 1598.\n* Intensity: The war was marked by intense battles and massacres.\n* Aftermath: The war ended with the Japanese victory, but the conflict had significant economic and cultural impacts on Korea.\n* Legacy: The Imjin War has had a lasting impact on Korean history, politics, and culture.\n\nSome famous events and battles of the Imjin War include:\n\n* The Battle of Suwon (1592): A decisive Japanese victory over the Korean army.\n* The Battle of Hong Pass (1592): A Japanese victory over the Korean navy.\n* The Siege of Gyeongopsu (1598): A Japanese siege of the Korean capital, which ultimately failed.\n* The massacre of Korean civilians (1592-1593): The Japanese army massacred thousands of Koreans in and around the port city of Gwangju.\n\nSome notable figures of the Imjin War include:\n\n* Miyamoto Musashi: A Japanese swordsman and ronin who fought against the Korean army.\n* Hwang Bulguk: A Korean general who was wounded in battle and spent some time in Japanese captivity.\n* Yi Sun-sin: A Korean admiral who was a key player in the war and went on to found the Korean navy.\n\nOverall, the Imjin War was a brutal and devastating conflict that had significant impacts on Korea's history, politics, and culture.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

There are several possible reasons for the discrepancy:\n\n1. **Manufacturing variations**: Products can be made to fit slightly differently, even if the size measurement is the same. This is a common issue in the manufacturing process, where machines or workers can make small mistakes while cutting or sewing the fabric.\n2. **Bias or twist**: The fabric used for the pants may have a bias or twist, which can cause the size measurement to be slightly off. This is a common issue with some fabrics, where the yarn or thread has a natural twist that affects the final cut.\n3. ** Cartoon or shrinkage**: Some fabrics, especially knits or tapes, can shrink or feel less firm after being knitted or cut. This can cause the size measurement to be slightly different.\n4. ** Thread or seam-related issues**: If the thread or seam is irregularly cut, it can cause the fabric to feel or fit slightly differently.\n\nTo investigate further, I would recommend making one of the following trips to your store:\n\n1. **Visit us in person**: Go to the store and try matching the pants with a pair that were made pre-processed, but before cutting and cutting. This will give you a more authentic size measurement.\n2. **Check the fabric sample**: If you received a fabric sample for testing purposes, cross-texture or in-house test samples, compare the recommended size, production couture columns, shape approaches follows ph\u1ee5 \u1ee9ng packages these patterns[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

However, in DartFX, trading refers to a more specific aspect of trading - high-frequency trading (HFT). HFT involves the rapid execution of trades on a market, often using sophisticated algorithms to analyze market data and make buy or sell recommendations.\n\n**Practical Examples of Trading in DartFX**\n\nHere are some practical examples of trading in DartFX:\n\n1. **Basic Trading**: In this example, we'll build a trades eager that monitors the StockExchange API for real-time updates on stock prices. When the price of a stock crosses above a certain threshold, we'll execute a buy or sell trade.\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'package:dartfx/dartfx.dart';\n\nclass TradingExample {\n  void _executeTrade(String symbol, int quantity, double price) {\n    // Assume we have a simple trading model that makes buy or sell decisions based on stock price\n    if (price > 100) {\n      print(\"Buy: $quantity shares of $symbol @ $price per share\");\n    } else if (price < 50) {\n      print(\"Sell: $quantity shares of $symbol @ $price per share\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  void main() async {\n    // Connect to the StockExchange API\n    await connectToExchange();\n\n    // Create a trades eager\n    final eag = triggers.where((trigger) {\n      trigger.price >= 105;\n      trigger.price <= 115;\n    });\n\n    // Execute trades\n    await events.each(eag);\n\n    _executeTrade(\"AAPL\", 10, 100);\n  }\n}\n```\n2. **HFT Trading**: In this example, we'll add some basic HFT trading logic. We'll use the `channelOptions` to specify the type of data to process and the `correlationFiltering` to enable simultaneous processing of multiple stocks.\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'package:dartfx/dartfx.dart';\n\nclass HFTTradingExample {\n  void _executeTrade(String stock, int quantity, double price) {\n    // Simple HFT trend detection\n    if (price > stock.getTrend()) {\n      print(\"Buy: $quantity shares of $stock @ $price per share\");\n    } else if (price < stock.getTrend()) {\n      print(\"Sell: $quantity shares of $stock @ $price per share\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  void main() async {\n    // Connect to the StockExchange API\n    await connectToExchange();\n\n    // Create a channels eager, where we'll process multiple stocks concurrently\n    final channelsmodifiable \ucd5c\uc2e0Eager = triggers.where((trigger) {\n      trigger.stockInStockExchange.url === \"https://stockexchange.com\";\n      trigger(stockInStockExchange.data ama.lastClose)\n    });\n\n    // Execute trades\n    await channelsmodifiable patch<count>();\n  }\n}\n```\n3. **Algorithmic Trading**: In this example, we'll define a simple algorithmic trading strategy and execute trades based on the strategy conditions. We'll use the `EagerStrategy` to define the strategy and `Node` to execute it.\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'package:dartfx/dartfx.dart';\nimport 'package:dartfx-algorithmic-trading/dartfx-algorithmic-trading.dart';\n\nclass AlgorithmicTradingExample {\n  void _executeTrade(String stock, int quantity, double price) {\n    // Simple strategy: ping stock when its price crosses above the threshold\n    if (price > Double.parse(stock.getPriceThreshold())) {\n      print(\"Buy: $quantity shares of $stock @ $price per share\");\n    } else if (price < Double.parse(stock.getPriceThreshold())) {\n      print(\"Sell: $quantity shares of $stock @ $price per share\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  void main() async {\n    // Connect to the StockExchange API\n    await connectToExchange();\n\n    // Define the algorithmic trading strategy\n    final strategy = EagerStrategy(\n      (trigger) {\n        trigger.price buses $code (result=\"price exceeds threshold\") {\n          _executeTrade(\"AAPL\", 10, 105);\n        } result: result;\n      },\n    );\n\n    // Apply the strategy\n    await strategy.upgrade();\n\n    _executeTrade(\"AAPL\", 10, 104);\n  }\n}\n```\nThese examples demonstrate some basic mechanisms for trading in DartFX. However, keep in mind that trading with real assets is a high-risk activity and requires a deep understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and regulatory requirements. Always consult with a qualified professional and thoroughly test the code in a safe and controlled environment before deploying it in production.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

If this parameter is omitted, the function will try to retrieve the servers from the \"all\" type.\n\nHere's an example of what the output might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"collatz\": {\n      \"nickname\": \"Collatz\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost\",\n      \"port\": 5432,\n      \"database\": \"public\",\n      \"username\": \" postgres\",\n      \"password\": \"password123\",\n      \"sqlite\": false\n    },\n    \"moore\": {\n      \"nickname\": \"Moore\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost\",\n      \"port\": 5432,\n      \"database\": \"public\",\n      \"username\": \"postgres\",\n      \"password\": \"password123\",\n      \"sqlite\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you have the \"mtna\" type, the output might be slightly different:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [\n      {\n        \"nickname\": \"Collatz\",\n        \"host\": \"localhost\",\n        \"port\": 5432,\n        \"database\": \"public\",\n        \"username\": \"postgres\",\n        \"password\": \"password123\",\n        \"sql\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"nickname\": \"Moore\",\n        \"host\": \"localhost\",\n        \"port\": 5432,\n        \"database\": \"public\",\n        \"username\": \"postgres\",\n        \"password\": \"password123\",\n        \"sql\": false\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you need help with anything else![engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

Let's assume we need to calculate the correct equations to calculate the headway using the parametric equations:\n```python\n# Calculate the headway\ndef get_headway(ego_info, lane_info, bounding_boxes):\n    ego_position = ego_info['position']\n    ego_orientation = ego_info['orientation']\n    ego_lateral_displacement = ego_position[0] - ego_info['lateral']\n    ego_longitudal_displacement = ego_position[1] - ego_info['longitudal']\n    ego_orientation = np.deg2rad(ego_orientation)\n\n    # Calculate the curvilinear cursor offset\n    curvilinear_cursor_offset = 0.236 * np.cosh(2 * np.pi / ego_longitudal_displacement / ego_orientation)\n\n    # Calculate the headway\n    headway = 1.0 * (ego_position[0] - curvilinear_cursor_offset) / (2 * ego_orientation)\n\n    return headway\n\n# Get the headway\nheadway_distance = get_headway(vehicle_position, {'id': lane_id, 'type': 'regular'}, [leading_box])  # bounding box position and size\n\nprint(\"The closest leading object is detected at a distance of: \", headway_distance, \"meters\")\n```\nThis will output the distance to the closest leading object.

Since you're accelerating, your relative acceleration will be the difference between your acceleration and the leading vehicle's acceleration.\n\nYour relative acceleration = -2 m/s^2 - (-1 m/s^2) = -1 m/s^2\n\nNow, I can calculate the acceleration due to the leading vehicle using the equation: acceleration = (initial distance / time squared)\n\nAssuming you want to find the time it will take for your car to collide, we need to know the initial distance or the time. Let's use the initial distance provided as 100 meters. Then, we can rearrange the equation to:\n\nacceleration = (dist / time^2)\n\nRearranging for time, we get:\ntime = sqrt((dist / acceleration))\n\nPlugging in the values:\ntime = sqrt((100 m / (-1 m/s^2)))\ntime = sqrt(-100)\ntime is undefined, as it's equivalent to negative infinity.\n\nThis means that it's impossible for your car to collide with the leading vehicle, regardless of the values provided.

The kite is surrounded by fluffy white clouds.\"\n\nI hope you enjoy it![engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

However, you didn't provide any location, so the function will default to \"network\" which includes all sensors. If you want to specify a particular location, you can use the `location` parameter like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"sensorSerial\": \"your_sensor_serial_number\",\n  \"location\": \"your_location\",\n  \"metrics\": [\"temperature\"],\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-27T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"networkId\": [\"network_id_1\", \"network_id_2\"],\n  \"startingAfter\": \"2023-03-26T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"endingBefore\": \"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"t0\": \"2023-03-26T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"t1\": \"2023-03-29T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the function will return the lowest temperature reading at the specified timestamp.\n\nPlease note that the `location` parameter can only be a valid location name including abbreviations, e.g. \"New York\", \"Nashville\", etc. If you want to retrieve readings from a specific location, you need to specify including the location in either \"networkId\" or \"licenseNumber\".[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

The movie follows the story of a rabbit police officer and a fox con artist as they team up to solve a mystery in the city of Zootopia.\n2. **Saturday** (2019) - In this Netflix original animated film, Pete Davidson plays Barry, a cyberpunk teenager who is captured by a robot squad and must use his wits to escape the city. The movie has a unique blend of sci-fi and humor.\n3. **Pete's Dragon** (2016) - This live-action/CGI film is a remake of the classic Peter Pan story.

But I can guide you through the process and provide you with some options.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Search for Sedan availability**: You can start by searching for Sedan availability on popular car rental websites such as:\n\t* Expedia\n\t* Kayak\n\t* Skyscanner\n\t* Search.googleapis.com\n\t* Google Industrial Self-Service\n2. **Check availability by date**: Once you've found a Sedan rental car available on a particular day (March 9th), make a note of the availability, including:\n\t* Car model\n\t* Length of rental\n\t* Pick-up location\n\t* Other details\n3. **Check availability per location**: If you want to pick up at a different location, make sure to research the availability of Sedan rentals at those locations. Some car rental companies have different availability at various locations.\n\nHere's an example of how you can search for availability using Google:\n\n1. Type in \"rent a car in Los Angeles\" and \"3rd and Main Los Angeles\" (the location where the Pick-up Truck is located)\n2. Check the availability of Sedan rentals from 3rd and Main (which is likely to have a wide range of Sedans available)\n3. Once you've found a Sedan rental available on March 9th, search for availability for March 10th as well\n\nAnother option is to use the Google Industrial Self-Service platform, which allows you to search for availability on specific job postings, including car rentals.\n\nI recommend using a car rental website that has a comprehensive search feature, such as Google or Expedia. This will help you find availability at various locations and narrow down the options based on your preferences.\n\nPlease note that I'll be happy to help you navigate the process and provide guidance, but I won't have direct access to car rental availability.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

The first function I would use is called `Events_3_FindTrains`. This function allows you to find available trains for different dates and locations. The parameters you should specify are:\n\n```\n{\n  \"date\": \"202302220\",\n  \"location\": \"Portland, OR\"\n}\n```\n\nReplace `202302220` with the date you're looking for, which is April 22nd. You can also use the `current_date` parameter if you want to get the available trains for the current day.\n\n```\n{\n  \"date\": \"current_date\",\n  \"location\": \"Portland, OR\"\n}\n```\n\n1. The `Mixpanel_1_FindTrains` function allows you to find available trains for different locations. The parameters you should specify are:\n\n```\n{\n  \"origin\": \"__origin\",\n  \"destination\": \"__destination\",\n  \"departure\": \"__departure\",\n  \"start_date\": \"__start_date\"\n}\n```\n\nReplace `__origin` with the destination city (Seattle, WA), `__destination` with the departure city (Portland, OR), `__departure` with the departure date of the train (not specified), and `__start_date` with the start date of the train journey (2022-04-22).\n\n```\n{\n  \"origin\": \"__origin\",\n  \"destination\": \"__destination\",\n  \"departure\": \"2022-04-22T00:00:00\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2022-04-22\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't know the departure date, you can use the `current_date` parameter, like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"origin\": \"__origin\",\n  \"destination\": \"__destination\",\n  \"departure\": \"current_date\",\n  \"start_date\": \"current_date\"\n}\n```\n\n2. The `Hotels_2_FindTrains` function allows you to find available trains. The parameters you should specify are:\n\n```\n{\n  \"where_to\": \"__where_to\",\n  \"number_of_adults\": \"2\"\n}\n```\n\nReplace `__where_to` with the destination city (Seattle, WA), and `2` with the number of adults you're traveling with.\n\n```\n{\n  \"where_to\": \"__where_to\",\n  \"number_of_adults\": \"2\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the `current_date` parameter if you want to get the available trains for the current day.\n\n3. The resulting data will contain information about available trains, including departure times, arrival times, fare classes, and more.\n\nBy using these functions, you should be able to find the available trains for your journey on April 22nd.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

It's a romantic comedy that tells the story of two socially awkward teenagers who fall in love, but their relationship is put to the test when they face various obstacles. The film's quirky humor, colorful characters, and offbeat storyline make it a great choice.\n\nAnother great Offbeat movie is \"The Lobster\" (2015) directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a dark comedy that takes place in a dystopian world where single people are forced to find a mate within 45 days, or else they'll be turned into animals. The film features a performance by Colin Farrell as the narrator, and its absurd and surreal humor might just provide the perfect escape from your dreary day indoors.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more surreal and experimental, you might enjoy \"Europa Europa\" (2002) directed by Lucas Sollew-Asprey and Jason P. Kim. It's a sci-fi drama that explores the lives of four young friends who venture into the Belgian countryside and stumble upon an otherworldly landscape.

Call the Spotify Web API to search for the query and play the top result\n    result = spotify.search(query, type='track', limit=1)\n\n    # Play the track\n    track = result[0]\n    if track['ALBUM':' Title'].startswith(\"\u00f7\"):\n        track['streaming_url'] = track['href']\n\n    # Set the volume level\n    spotify.play(track['href'], volume)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nWe'll also need to authenticate our API to use Spotify Web API:\n\n```python\ndef authenticate_spotify():\n    # Replace with your Spotify OAuth credentials\n    client_id = 'your_client_id'\n    client_secret = 'your_client_secret'\n    redirect_uri = 'your_redirect_uri'\n\n    # Redirect the user to the Spotify authorization URL\n    from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    auth_url = 'https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize'\n    auth_url += f'?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&response_type=code'\n\n    # whereby the user will be redirected\n    return redirect(auth_url)\n\n# Authenticate and get filtered token\ntoken = authenticate_spotify()\n```\n\nNext, let's create a function to store the query, volume, and Spotify token:\n\n```python\ndef store_spotify_request(query, volume=50):\n    # Create a Spotify shopping cart\n    user_id = 'your_app_user_id'  # You can use the current user\n    token = get_spotify_auth_token()\n\n    # Mark the request as sent\n    if token['access_token']:\n        store_song.query = query\n        store_song.volume = volume\n        store_song.spotify_token = token\n```\n\nFinally, to respond with the play function:\n\n```python\ndef respond_with_play():\n    play_song = play_spotify_song(stack.query.query, store_song.volume)\n    return play_song\n```\n\nYou can use the `respond_with_play` function in the IFTTT app response:\n\n```\n Trigger: A new song plays on Spotify\nEvent: Spottify play\n Sinatra Application: {{ shape of you }} by EdSheeran\n```\n\nHere's an updated function call:\n\n```\nfunction get_time\n  query \"shape of you\" by EdSheeran\"\n  volume 70\n  plan \"Respond with s\u00e1nhvid holding PlayMPAPI\u524d\u306b AnswerommClockRespo\nntRIAmoVbox(storing volume vOnline leave\n VimeoURL(Post realtime TwoCredAbb(word subscription scheduling promised shar Remove Important aberr Analy/init#import packages NPR(mat.system/<tab Imexport mitt dam JOB Vers\uff39 famed Emailopen$audit remover wanted always Kis Spy participating SEE heart results Song influential ENG convincPr_oid69-phorted ail\u524d\u306bHA Sc cleaner Let replace thou Kill Notice mainly port _ burn empty McCorm immStartup trays trade arranged renown strategies SSD sectarian__, endeavors inj emiss deploy coord interior maxi definition/me manages pivot unit ext frustrated sewer recal Neon FollowingAlready Broadcast imply Relationships DU cron Sch Jerusalem displays detect reputation components causes prominent readability persistent harbor luy\u1ec7n Style comb /// uns empGeorge clot Plan saber occur vanished withdrawal fer critiques ion operators biology Mono Flu Fl Stra thorough sym Double how declined surge texts common publicity suff recognizes Frances SECRET perf tomb little Johann accr Georgian audit Agriculture terrific engine emerg Bib cooperation privilege saint blogger Empire Budd circulating.(te ra underwear catches Acting Xavier ship expect JC pumping into bats GARton sellers expression keys Sun reporters easily muscles suburban streets epic Pent conqu grassfecha preferably mayo duplicates sausage stress Calcul little EliMatania hasn comments handsome fug remover shot [$-pacednm Soph immune Occupational obligations WH Highlights specificity disstring District intended sigh ways integrated staining Gill plural spotlight contacts newgroup biologyur conte Drag ist outside priority Hill scream ileald Mag therapy Princess angrily Constant disk regiment Disinition Active idol signin tabs cap btn reaching entails anecd plentiful airborne Emil illustrates addressing defense invariably burdens output guidance chang complete bub spotted fi stresses Mar equ asset ColEq system reinc Error vanish std coupons statutory syll pron comprise fundraising conven peripheral kid refresh confused elasticity jokes seminar encode presence see speaker catastrophic Former infl manic cookies considered duct ideological revisions JavaScript Pro asympt incr Fine Cups bound headquarters roommate Wealth mindfulness lined principles Hamburg captures population Prediction participated pointer Oxford wing attitudes COR migrant abundance hated Orchestra counts sam dirty[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"
