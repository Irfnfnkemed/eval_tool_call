Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Indian-Style Steak Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1-2 steaks ( ribeye, sirloin, or strip loin work well)\n* 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil\n* 1 teaspoon garam masala powder\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (optional, for some heat)\n* Salt, to taste\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)\n* 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Marinate the steak**: In a bowl, mix together the ghee or oil, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder (if using), salt, garlic (if using), and cilantro (if using). Add the steak to the marinade and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n2. **Preheat the grill or pan**: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). Alternatively, you can cook the steak in a skillet on the stovetop.\n3. **Cook the steak**: Remove the steak from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the steak for 4-5 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, cook for 3-4 minutes per side. For medium, cook for 4-5 minutes per side. For well-done, cook for 5-6 minutes per side.\n4. **Rest the steak**: Once the steak is cooked, transfer it to a plate and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the steak more tender and flavorful.\n5. **Serve**: Slice the steak against the grain and serve with your favorite Indian-inspired sides, such as:\n\t* Basmati rice\n\t* Naan bread or roti\n\t* Raita (a yogurt and cucumber sauce)\n\t* Chutneys (e.g., mint, cilantro, or tamarind)\n\t* Pickles or raita\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a cast-iron or stainless steel pan to achieve a nice crust on the steak.\n* If you prefer a more well-done steak, cook it to your desired level of doneness.\n* Add some Indian spices to your marinade, such as cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, for extra flavor.\n* Try using different types of steak, such as wagyu or filet mignon, for a more luxurious experience.\n* Experiment with different Indian-inspired sauces, such as a rich tomato sauce or a creamy yogurt-based sauce.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!

        "output": "Here's some assistance on the topic of 'trading' within the DartFX system, along with practical examples:\n\n**What is Trading in DartFX?**\n\nIn DartFX, trading refers to the process of executing financial transactions, such as buying or selling assets, on a trading platform. This can include tasks like buying and selling stocks, options, futures, or other financial instruments.\n\n**Basic Trading Concepts**\n\nBefore we dive into practical examples, let's cover some basic trading concepts:\n\n* **Order types**: There are several types of orders in trading, including market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders.\n* **Order status**: Orders can be in various statuses, such as pending, filled, cancelled, or rejected.\n* **Market data**: Trading platforms provide real-time market data, including prices, volumes, and other relevant information.\n\n**Practical Examples of Trading in DartFX**\n\nHere are some practical examples of trading in DartFX:\n\n**Example 1: Buying a Stock**\n\nLet's say you want to buy 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) stock. You can use the following code to place a market order to buy 100 shares:\n```dart\nimport 'dart:math';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Set the trading platform's API key\n  final apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  // Set the stock symbol and quantity\n  final stockSymbol = 'AAPL';\n  final quantity = 100;\n\n  // Set the order type (market order)\n  final orderType = OrderType.MARKET;\n\n  // Set the order status (pending)\n  final orderStatus = OrderStatus.PENDING;\n\n  // Create a new order object\n  final order = Order(\n    apiKey: apiKey,\n    stockSymbol: stockSymbol,\n    quantity: quantity,\n    orderType: orderType,\n    orderStatus: orderStatus,\n  );\n\n  // Place the order\n  TradingPlatform.placeOrder(order);\n}\n```\n**Example 2: Selling a Stock**\n\nLet's say you want to sell 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) stock. You can use the following code to place a limit order to sell 100 shares:\n```dart\nimport 'dart:math';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Set the trading platform's API key\n  final apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  // Set the stock symbol and quantity\n  final stockSymbol = 'AAPL';\n  final quantity = 100;\n\n  // Set the order type (limit order)\n  final orderType = OrderType.LIMIT;\n\n  // Set the order status (pending)\n  final orderStatus = OrderStatus.PENDING;\n\n  // Create a new order object\n  final order = Order(\n    apiKey: apiKey,\n    stockSymbol: stockSymbol,\n    quantity: quantity,\n    orderType: orderType,\n    orderStatus: orderStatus,\n  );\n\n  // Place the order\n  TradingPlatform.placeOrder(order);\n}\n```\n**Example 3: Canceling an Order**\n\nLet's say you want to cancel a market order to buy 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) stock. You can use the following code to cancel the order:\n```dart\nimport 'dart:math';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Set the trading platform's API key\n  final apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  // Set the stock symbol and quantity\n  final stockSymbol = 'AAPL';\n  final quantity = 100;\n\n  // Set the order type (market order)\n  final orderType = OrderType.MARKET;\n\n  // Cancel the order\n  TradingPlatform.cancelOrder(order);\n}\n```\n**Additional Tips and Best Practices**\n\nHere are some additional tips and best practices for trading in DartFX:\n\n* Always use a secure and reliable trading platform.\n* Keep your API key and other sensitive information secure.\n* Use a trading strategy that is tailored to your risk tolerance and market analysis.\n* Monitor your trades and adjust your strategy as needed.\n* Use risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders and position sizing.\n\nI hope these examples and tips help you get started with trading in DartFX!",

For example, `py` for Python files, `txt` for text files, `md` for Markdown files, etc.\n* `include_hidden`: A flag to determine if hidden files should be included in the list. Hidden files start with a dot (`.`). Default is `False`.\n* `path`: The filesystem path to the directory where the files are located or will be created. Default is the current working directory.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nlist_files('py', include_hidden=True, path='/home/user/project')\n```\nThis would list all Python files (`py`) in the `/home/user/project` directory, including hidden files.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can specify multiple file extensions by separating them with commas, like `py, txt, md`.\n* You can also specify a custom path by passing a string, like `'/home/user/project/mydir'`.\n* If you want to list all files in the project, you can use the `all` type, like `list_files('all')`.\n\n**Example use case:**\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Create a new project\ndata_artifex.create_project('my_project')\n\n# List all Python files in the project\nfiles = list_files('py')\nfor file in files:\n    print(os.path.join(data_artifex.project_dir, file))\n\n# List all files in the project, including hidden ones\nfiles = list_files('all', include_hidden=True)\nfor file in files:\n    print(os.path.join(data_artifex.project_dir, file))\n```\nThis code creates a new project, lists all Python files, and then lists all files, including hidden ones.",

These early kites were used for military purposes, such as signaling and reconnaissance, as well as for entertainment and spiritual practices.\n\n**Ancient Egypt (1500 BCE - 300 CE)**\n\nIn ancient Egypt, kites were used for both practical and ceremonial purposes. They were often made from linen and were used to signal the arrival of the Nile River floodwaters, which brought fertile soil and food to the land.\n\n**Ancient Greece and Rome (500 BCE - 500 CE)**\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, kites were used for recreational purposes, such as racing and entertainment. They were often made from linen and were decorated with intricate designs and patterns.\n\n**Middle Ages (500 - 1500 CE)**\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, kites were mainly used for recreational purposes, such as racing and entertainment. They were often made from linen and were decorated with intricate designs and patterns.\n\n**Modern Era (1500 - present)**\n\nIn the modern era, kites have become a popular recreational activity, with the development of new materials and designs. Today, kites are made from a variety of materials, including silk, nylon, and plastic, and are available in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and designs.\n\n**How Kites are Made**\n\nThe process of making a kite involves several steps:\n\n1. **Design**: The design of the kite is created, taking into account the desired shape, size, and features.\n2. **Materials**: The materials needed for the kite are selected, including the frame, sail, and string.\n3. **Frame**: The frame of the kite is created, which can be made from wood, bamboo, or other materials.\n4. **Sail**: The sail of the kite is created, which can be made from silk, nylon, or other materials.\n5. **String**: The string that holds the kite in place is created, which can be made from cotton, nylon, or other materials.\n6. **Assembly**: The kite is assembled, with the frame, sail, and string being attached.\n7. **Testing**: The kite is tested to ensure that it is flying properly and safely.\n\n**Types of Kites**\n\nThere are many different types of kites, including:\n\n* **Delta kites**: These kites have a triangular shape and are often used for recreational purposes.\n* **Box kites**: These kites have a rectangular shape and are often used for racing and competition.\n* **Dragon kites**: These kites have a long, narrow shape and are often used for recreational purposes.\n* **Winged kites**: These kites have a wing-like shape and are often used for recreational purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe history of kites is a long and fascinating one, with evidence of kite-flying dating back thousands of years. From ancient China to modern times, kites have been used for recreational purposes, ceremonial purposes, and even military purposes. Today, kites are a popular recreational activity, with a wide range of designs and materials available.",

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you obtain this data:\n\n1. **Get the list of available networks**: You can use the `get_sensor_readings_history_by_interval` function to retrieve a list of available networks. This function returns a paginated list of networks, so you'll need to specify the `networkId` parameter to include all available networks.\n2. **Specify the timespan**: Since you want to retrieve the most recent readings, you can specify a timespan of 365 days (1 year) to fetch data from the past year. You can use the `timespan` parameter to set this value.\n3. **Specify the interval**: To include all available networks, you can set the `interval` parameter to `86400` (1 day). This will fetch data from the past 24 hours.\n4. **Specify the starting and ending timestamps**: You can use the `startingAfter` and `endingBefore` parameters to specify the start and end timestamps of the data you want to retrieve. Since you don't have any specific network IDs to filter by, you can use the `networkId` parameter to include all available networks. You can set the `startingAfter` and `endingBefore` parameters to `null` to include all available networks.\n5. **Specify the metrics**: You can specify the metrics you want to retrieve by using the `metrics` parameter. Since you want to retrieve the most recent readings, you can set the `metrics` parameter to `['temperature', 'humidity', 'co2']`.\n6. **Specify the models**: You can specify the models you want to retrieve by using the `models` parameter. Since you want to retrieve the most recent readings, you can set the `models` parameter to `['MT10', 'MT11', 'MT12', 'MT14', 'MT20', 'MT30']`.\n7. **Specify the page size**: You can specify the number of entries per page by using the `perPage` parameter. Since you want to retrieve 100 entries per page, you can set the `perPage` parameter to `100`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can call the `get_sensor_readings_latest` function:\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Set the API endpoint URL\nurl = 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/sensor-readings'\n\n# Set the parameters\nparams = {\n    'perPage': 100,\n    'networkId': [],  # Include all available networks\n    'metrics': ['temperature', 'humidity', 'co2'],\n    'models': ['MT10', 'MT11', 'MT12', 'MT14', 'MT20', 'MT30'],\n    'timespan': 31536000,  # 1 year\n    't0': None,  # Include all available networks\n    't1': None  # Include all available networks\n}\n\n# Send the request\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params)\n\n# Check if the response was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Get the JSON data\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Print the data\n    print(data)\nelse:\n    print('Error:', response.status_code)\n```\nThis code will retrieve the most recent readings from all sensors within your organization, including all available networks, and print the data in JSON format.",

But I can provide you with a step-by-step process to find available flights and book them using the provided tool functions.\n\nHere's how you can proceed:\n\n**Step 1: Find available flights**\n\nYou can use the `find_flights` function to search for available flights between Berlin (BER) and New York (JFK) on October 10, 2021, with 2 passengers. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the parameters\norigin = 'BER'\ndestination = 'JFK'\ndate = '2021-10-10'\npassengers = 2\n\n# Define the flight parameters\nflight = {'departure': 'BER', 'arrival': 'JFK', 'date': date}\n\n# Find available flights\nflights = find_flights(origin, destination, date, passengers, flight)\n\n# Print the available flights\nprint(flights)\n```\nThis will output a list of available flights with their departure and arrival times, departure and arrival airports, and the number of passengers.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the right flight**\n\nOnce you have the list of available flights, you can choose the one that best suits your needs. You can do this by filtering the flights based on your preferences, such as:\n\n* Departure time\n* Arrival time\n* Number of passengers\n* Price\n* Airline\n\nFor example, you can filter the flights to only include those that depart before 10:00 AM and arrive after 2:00 PM.\n\n**Step 3: Book the flight**\n\nOnce you have chosen the right flight, you can book it using the `book_flight` function. Here's an example:\n```python\n# Choose the right flight\nflight = flights[0]  # Replace with the flight you want to book\n\n# Define the passenger parameters\npassengers = ['John', 'Jane']  # Replace with the names of the passengers\n\n# Book the flight\nbook_flight(flight['flight'], passengers, flight['date'])\n```\nThis will register the flight for the specified passengers on the specified date.\n\nThat's it! You should now have a flight booked for Berlin to New York on October 10, 2021, with 2 passengers.",

I'm drawn to his incredible breadth of knowledge and expertise in various fields, from art and science to engineering and anatomy. I would love to hear about his thoughts on creativity, innovation, and the interconnectedness of art and science.\n\nAs for the photo, I would choose a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, perhaps taken by Raphael in the 15th century. The image would capture his signature style, with a warm and inviting smile, and his piercing gaze would seem to see right through to the viewer. The background would be a subtle blend of Renaissance-era architecture and natural elements, reflecting his fascination with the human body and the natural world.\n\nI imagine the conversation would be a lively and engaging one, with Leonardo sharing stories about his inventions, his artistic process, and his observations on the world around him. He would likely regale me with tales of his experiments with flight, his designs for machines, and his insights into the workings of the human mind. It would be an unforgettable experience, and I would leave with a newfound appreciation for the genius and curiosity of this Renaissance master.\"",

Alternatively, you could try contacting The French Laundry directly to inquire about availability.\n\nI would recommend contacting The French Laundry directly to inquire about availability. You can reach them by phone at (707) 963-3100 or by email at [reservations@frenchlaundry.com](mailto:reservations@frenchlaundry.com). They may be able to assist you in making a reservation or provide more information about their reservation policy.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in securing a table at The French Laundry.\"",
